INTRODUCTION                                                            *joy*


tl;dr:

    :imap <tab> <esc>
    (See: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi#Creation >)

IBM made some really odd decisions in popularizing the current keyboard, so
we're taking the power back.

This is the real heart of vim-joy. Just make it so hitting tab in Insert mode
gets you out into Normal mode.

The only extra complexity is due to the "Training Wheels" needed to get used
to not being able to hit tab normally. This is most surprising when:

* When on an empty line, meaning "increase indent". Use <C-t> instead.
* When in the middle of a line, and trying to line things up. I don't have an
  exact solution for this, other than to do the work in Normal mode (e.g. with
  <C-v> combined with << and >>)

To affect the behavior of this plugin, you can either:

                                                                *'g:joy_pure'*

   let g:joy_pure = 1

Commit to using <C-t> instead of <Tab> for indentation. At this point it
becomes identical in behavior to Insert Mode <Tab> == <Esc>.

                                                               *'g:joy_mixed'*

   let g:joy_mixed = 1

To turn off the nag message, and forget about <C-t> for indent.

TEMPORARILY DISABLING                                           *'joy-temp'*

Sometimes you want to affect the behavior only for this session (e.g. for pair
programming with someone who isn't feeling it)

To go back to impure mode:

   :unlet g:joy_pure

To make <Tab> be default in behavior:

   :unimap <Tab>

THANKS                                                            *joy-thanks*

Thanks to tpope, as always!
